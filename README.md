# CF-Chat
I wrote this Chat Script for a Project I was Working on and had decided to include it here.

This Script is very Light-weight and is very easy on your webserver as everything is run through the Application and Session Scopes, there are However Two Database Tables that must be used in order to use it correctly, included in the package. 

This Chat uses the use of a Modal Window, Some JQuery for the Administration End and has a nice Source PNG File included for modifying the layout of the Actual Chat Screen. 

This Script also supports the use of Chat Transcripts, and if a user closes the Modal window the system archives the chat and closes thier Session.
